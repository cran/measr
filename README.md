The goal of measr is to provide a user-friendly interface for estimating
and evaluating educational measurement, or psychometric, models with
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/).
Initial development work is focused on diagnostic classification models
(DCMs; also known as cognitive diagnosis models \[CDMs\]). This project
is still in development and should not be considered stable. The API is
likely to change as development progresses until the package is
officially released to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
